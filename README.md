## Summary
We made a tile based, 2D dungeon crawler game with top-down oblique perspective. There is a cave among the trees in the forest.<br/>
When our character enters the cave, little monsters appear in front of him and begin to attack our character. <br/>
The cave consists of three floors and when we kill all the creatures on the floor, we can move on to the next floor. <br/>
On the last floor (fourth floor), there is the end game boss which spawns those creatures. <br/>
When the boss is killed, the game is over, and the trees are safe.
